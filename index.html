                <p>Hey, friends. Kevin the Corgi here. For all our new followers, let me give you some background on what Daisy and I do in our spare time. 
                    While our human thinks we're lazing around in the backyard (what mom don't know, won't hurt her. Am I right?) we are actually traveling
                    to places that our human only dreams about! It all started when we found this hidden portal while burrowing under our fence (long story 
                    short, it had to do with a <b>pesky dog food stealing vermin</b>. It's a great story but this isn't what today's post is about) and our lives 
                    have never been the same...
                </p>
            </article>

            <div class="col-6">
                <p>This is from our first trip. We were a little star struck (pun intended) with all the new surroundings! We wandered aimlessly most of the time, but
                    we found so many friendly people that shared their food and drinks with us. We didn't take advantage of all we could do here, but who could blame us? 
                    We weren't even sure if the portal would lead back to home! We went back to the hole in a wall restaurant where there was a literal hole in the wall 
                    we came out of and after crossing our fingers (<em>metaphorically, obviously</em>) we found ourselves back in our own backyard. Our human didn't seem to notice. 
                    Since we can't tell time (and not to mention the mindf*ck that goes along with portal traveling) we have no way of knowing how time works while we're away. 
                    One thing is for sure, no matter how long we're gone we always make it back before dinner.
