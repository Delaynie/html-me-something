                <p class="padding-top">Hey, friends. Kevin the Corgi here. For all our new followers, let me give you some background on what Daisy and I do in our spare time. 
                    While our human thinks we're lazing around in the backyard (what mama don't know, don't hurt her. Am I right?) we are actually traveling
                    to places that our human only dreams about!<br>
                    It all started when we found this hidden portal while burrowing under our fence (long story 
                    short, it had to do with a <em>pesky dog food stealing vermin</em>. It's a great story but this isn't what today's post is about) and our lives 
                    have never been the same...Take a look at some of the highlights of our favorite trips!
                </p>

                <p>Since we can't tell time (and not to mention the mindf*ck that goes along with portal traveling) we have no way of knowing how time works while we're away. 
                    One thing is for sure, no matter how long we're gone we always make it back home for dinner.
